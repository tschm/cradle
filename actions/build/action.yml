name: Build package
description: "Build the package"

# Input parameters for customizing the action
inputs:
  tag:
    description: 'The version tag to use for the release'
    required: true  # This parameter must be provided

runs:
  using: "composite"  # Indicates this is a composite action (combination of multiple steps)

  steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
    - name: Checkout [${{ github.repository }}]
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Update version in pyproject.toml using regex (for PEP 621 or Poetry format)
    # Note: There are two version update steps that appear to do similar things
    - name: Update version in pyproject.toml
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo "Updating version to ${{ inputs.tag }}"
        VERSION="${{ inputs.tag }}"
        # Use a regex to find and replace the version line (works for PEP 621 or Poetry)
        sed -i -E "s/^version = \".*\"/version = \"${VERSION}\"/" pyproject.toml

    # Step 4: Build the Python package using hatch
    - name: Build package
      shell: bash
      run: |
        python -m pip install hatch  # Install the build tool
        hatch build  # Build the package (creates files in dist/)

    # Step 5: Upload the built package as an artifact
    - name: Upload distribution artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: dist  # Name of the artifact
        path: dist/  # Path to the directory containing the built package
        retention-days: 1  # Keep artifacts for 1 day to save storage

    # Step 6: Create a GitHub release with the built package
    - name: Create GitHub release with artifacts
      uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ inputs.tag }}  # Use the provided tag for the release
        generate_release_notes: true  # Automatically generate release notes
        files: dist/*  # Include all files from the dist directory
